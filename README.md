# Vector-Robot-Particle-Filter-Localization
# Overview
This is a robot localization project done for a robotics class. The robot used is Vector by Digital Dream Labs. Vector rotates in place and observes images on an otherwise plain wall to determine where it is in an enclosed arena. Using this information, Vector performs a delivery procedure in which it takes a block from the loading zone of the arena to the dropoff point. This delivery process is repeated 5 times to amplify the error of an inaccurate localization over time. There is a 3 minute time limit to force Vector to balance speed with accuracy.
# Localization details
Vector knows where the images are located within the arena ahead of time, but it does not know anything about the content these images. Vector uses a particle filter machine learning model in which each particle is an (x, y) coordinate representing the robot's possible position in the arena. These particles are updated iteratively by Vector's camera feed while it rotates in place and observes the distance, angle, and count of images it sees. This process is repeated until the particles are close enough together for Vector to be confident about its position in the arena to begin delivery.
